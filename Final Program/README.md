# Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) Project
This was the big project of the semester. I along with Kutter Aaron & Jacob Ciurca implemented a simulation of a Optimized Link State Routing Protocol. It is an enhanced version of the Link State Routing Protocol which utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm with some notable differences:
* A type of link state routing protocol
* Developed for mobile and Ad Hoc networks
* Table driven, Proactive protocol
* Minimizes the Overhead Compared to LSR Protocol
* Use Multi Relay Points (MRPs) to designate which neighbors to send their info to

Our simulated network is attached that was used to show our protocol in action represented by the json files.
* **LSR:** contains the link state routing
* **OLSR:** contians the optimized link state routing
